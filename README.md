# MLP Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network from scratch, without relying on high-level deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The project is intended for educational purposes, providing insights into the underlying mechanics of neural networks.

## Features

- Fully connected neural network implementation.
- Customizable number of layers and neurons.
- Forward and backward propagation.
- Activation functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, and softmax.
- Loss functions including mean squared error (MSE) and cross-entropy.
- Gradient descent optimization.
